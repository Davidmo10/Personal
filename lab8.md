- Beginning with your [user stories from last lab](userstories.csv), create a product backlog by ordering them by priority. Consult your TA in the role of product owner to do this. Identify and break down epics and uncover misunderstandings by estimating effort (S, M, L, XL) as in the Scrum Training Series.
- After ~40 minutes, commit to a subset of the backlog items for Sprint 1, which begins Wednesday (10/25). We will present our products 2 weeks from Wednesday (11/8).
- Now generate tasks, and estimate completion time on the tasks. Team members should volunteer to take on tasks. You may do initial designing to help clarify tasks. (Bill will write tests for Class A). It is a good idea to use scrum software like taiga.io for this, but you can also use a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
