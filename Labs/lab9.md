# Lab 9
Each group should get their design documents and tests in order. At minimum, there should be a 1 page class diagram detailing the interface of and relationship between each class. And there should be test suites of unit tests associated with each class. One possible organization would be one suite per class, and one test case per method, with many tests per test case.

After 30 minutes to prepare, group will exchange this material and do a formal code review of the tests. Remember, tests should be atomic, independent, and as a set should be comprehensive. They should correctly describe the intended behavior of each method.

Groups should share the list of all defects found in the code review with the original group. Allow 15 minutes to read the tests before starting the review.
