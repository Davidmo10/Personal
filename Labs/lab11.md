#Lab 11
1. (30 min) Following the guidelines of the Scrum Training Series, conduct a Sprint Retrospective meeting

2. (45 min) Identify practices you group found useful, and struggles you had in sprint 1.
   For each useful practice , identify possible alternatives, and why they are inferior to your chosen practice.
   For each struggle, identify possible alternative practices that could remedy the problem, and for each of these list possible advantages and disadvantages relative to your current practice.

   | Tables   | Need        | Headers  |
   | -------- |-------------| ----- |
   | Practice | Alternative | Why ours is better |
   | Struggle | Change in practice that might address struggle |	Advantages/Disadvantages |

   Each struggle should detail what you did, what was the intended outcome, and what was the actual outcome. For example, "we maintained our task board by sending email with the updated task board attached. We thought this would allow us to keep up to date on sprint progress, but after multiple cases of people working off of an inconsistent task board because the used an older email we couldn't determine what was actually done." Struggles should not suggest possible solutions.

3. (30 min) Exchange these 2 tables with another group, and do a "code review" on the document. Look for alternatives that original group missed, defective struggle descriptions, missing or incorrect advantages/disadvantages.
