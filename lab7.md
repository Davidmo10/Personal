# Lab 7
In this lab you will create a list of user stories that describe all the ways a user might interact with the software. This is the software's feature list. In scrum, it is called the Product Backlog, and the individual user stories are Product Backlog Items (PBIs). Unlike use case, PBIs are user focused and include a definition of done (how will we know when this is complete).

Large PBIs, called epics, should be broken into smaller ones. PBIs are not tasks, they don't address what developers need to do. They are user focused statements of what the software needs to do. Read the accompanying articles to get a better idea about user stories.

Traditionally user stories are written on a 3x5 card, with the definition of done on the back. You should post a table in your group discussion forum with the user story in one column and the corresponding definition of done in the other.
